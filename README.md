# COMS30035 Machine Learning Labs

You are encouraged to install [Anaconda (Python 3.7)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as it bundles all the course's requirements.
Alternatively for manual installation, you will require Python 3.7.x with 'Jupyter' and 'iPython' both possibly in version 4.x.x. All the packages needed will be listed at the beginning of each lab sheet.

If you login remotely to the university Linux machines, you should be able to just run Jupyter Notebook with this command
```sh
$ /opt/anaconda3-4.4.0/bin/jupyter notebook
```

For help on logging in remotely to Bristol machines see [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/teaching-remote-access.aspx).
