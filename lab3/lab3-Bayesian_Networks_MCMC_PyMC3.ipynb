    "Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are a set of algorithms with the purpose of generating samples from a distribution. Let's break down the meaning of the individual terms:\n",
    "  - **Monte Carlo** simply refers to the idea of approximating a complicated system with a statistical sample.\n",
    "  - A **Markov chain** refers to a stochastic process involving a number of probabilisitic state transitions from one state to another. The **Markov** property states that any given state transition probability is determined by only the current state not any of the preceding states.\n",
    " \n",
    "Together, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are a set of methods that utilise a Markov chain to generate samples from some desired distribution. The Markov chain transition probabilites are set up in such a way that the sequence of sampled states of the chain will eventually converge to this desired distribution. Note that the initial states of the chain may be far from the desired distribution which is why they are typically discarded."

    "We will first define a simple distribution that we intend to generate samples from. In the cell below, create a function `gaussian_pdf` that has parameters mean ($\\mu$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$) and returns a function for the Gaussian probability density function corresponding to those parameters: $$\\Large p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use the `norm` function from [`scipy.stats.norm`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html) or define this function directly from the equation using `numpy`. Note that `gaussian_pdf` should take just two parameters (`mu` and `sigma`) and should **return a function** $p(x)$ that takes a single parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation it may be useful to use a `lambda` function which is a very useful `Python` feature that allows the creation of anonymous functions. If this concept is unfamiliar to you then please see this python tutorial [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp)."

    "The Metropolis Algorithm is one of the simplest instances of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The goal of the algorithm is to generate samples from some distribution $p(z)$ which in our case is an univariate Gaussian distribution. Let us assume that we do not have an easy way to sample from this distribution (in reality this distribution is very easy to sample from) and that we can only evaluate the unnormalised density, $\\tilde{p}(z)$, where\n",
    "$$\\large p(z) = \\frac{\\tilde{p}(z)}{Z_p}$$ and $Z_p$ may be unknown or computationally intractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate samples, $z_1, z_2, ... z_N$ , from $p(z)$ using an MCMC method such as the Metropolis algorithm we must first define a proposal distribution, $q(z_{t+1}^\\star \\vert z_{t})$, that uses the current state in the chain, $z_t$, to propose new states, $z_{t+1}^\\star$. The only requirements for this proposal distribution are that it can easily be sampled directly and that it is symmetric (although this method can be extended for non-symmetric proposal distributions). For simplicity, in this case we will choose to use a Gaussian proposal distribution with a mean of $z_t$ and a fixed variance $\\sigma_\\star^2$: \n",
    "$$\\large z_{t+1}^\\star \\sim \\mathcal{N}(z_t, \\sigma_\\star^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "[comment]: <> (At this point, to clarify, we have an unnormalised density corresponding to the distribution that we wish to be able to sample from and proposal distribution that we can easily sample from. Both distributions are Gaussian to keep things simple for this exercise but remember that this algorithm can be applied to any density.)\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial value for the first state, $z_1$, is chosen at the beginning and is used to propose a value for the next state. The newly proposed value is either accepted as the next state in the chain, $z_2 = z_2^\\star$, or it is rejected, $z_2 = z_1$. Acceptance occurs probabilistically with an acceptance probability of:\n",
    "$$\\large A(z_{t+1}^\\star, z_t) = \\text{min}\\Big(1, \\frac{\\tilde{p}(z_{t+1}^\\star)}{\\tilde{p}(z_t)}\\Big)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when $\\tilde{p}(z_{t+1}^\\star)\\geq\\tilde{p}(z_t)$ the new sample is always accepted. It turns out that if we take enough samples in this way then the distribution of $z_t$ converges to $p(z)$."

    "1. Estimate the mean and variance of the true distribution from your samples. How does the accuracy of these estimates change if you generate more samples?\n",
    "2. The current implementation uses a normalised Gaussian pdf. Think about what would happen if the density function was unnormalised. Change `gaussian_pdf` to multiply all of its outputs by some constant value and check that you were correct.\n",
    "3. Go back to Section 2.1 and experiment with different density functions:\n",
    "    - Create a function `gaussian_mixture_pdf` that returns the density function for a mixture of two Gaussians with parameters: $\\mu_1 = -2, \\sigma_1=0.5, \\mu_2=2, \\sigma_2=0.5$. This can be achieved simply by creating the two density functions separately using `gaussian_pdf` and summing the result. Set this density to `true_pdf` and run the rest of your code again to generate and plot the distribution of samples from the Gaussian mixture. What do you notice about the distribution of your samples?\n",
    "    - (Optional) Implement the density function for a Uniform distribution, `uniform_pdf`, over the range $(-2, 2)$ and run the code again. (hint: you can use [scipy.stats.uniform](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.uniform.html) or implement it yourself using numpy)."

    "### Exercises:\n",
    "1. Experiment with changing the prior distributions within the model: \n",
    "    - How does changing the prior distributions' mean or variance affect the posterior belief?\n",
    "    - What happens if the uniform distribution prior over $\\sigma$ is changed to exclude the true value? (e.g. $p(\\sigma) = U(5, 20)$)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Introduce a new parameter, $w_2$, to the data generation code such that\n",
    "    $$ y_i = w_0 + w_1x_i + w_2x_i^2+ \\epsilon$$\n",
    "   and adjust the model to perform inference for this parameter from the data.\n",

    "## Wrap up\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covered a number of topics so let's recap:\n",
    "- First, we looked at a simple example of a graphical model and showed how to go about efficiently generating samples from a distribution that factorises over the graph using ancestral sampling.\n",
    "- We demonstrated the power of sampling by using samples to estimate quantities relating to the distribution.\n",
    "- We then looked at using the concepts of MCMC algorithms to generate samples from probability densities that are otherwise difficult to sample from and implemented the Metropolis algorithm.\n",
    "- Finally, we looked at the PyMC3 python library and how its efficient implementations of MCMC algorithms can be utilised within a Bayesian Linear Regression model.\n",
